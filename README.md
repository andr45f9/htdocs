This project is to show my work with sql databases and php.
We have been using MAMP to start a apache server to run our application on. 
We have been using phpMyAdmin as our sql database.
We have been using tailwindcss as our styling tool.

In the .gitignore file I have included a whole folder (api), which contains sql queries with different actions to the database.
