This project is to show my work with sql databases and php.
We have been using MAMP to start a apache server to run our application on. 
We have been using phpMyAdmin as our sql database.
We have been using tailwindcss as our styling tool.

In the .gitignore file I have included a whole folder (api), which contains sql queries with different actions to the database.

TO RUN THE APPLICATION:
1) Download MAMP
2) Start an Apache server
3) Go to localhost in your browser (127.0.0.1 er for mac users then 127.0.0.1:8888)
4) Then you can try and login with "a@a.com" as the email and "password" as the password
